## datasets
the datasets folder contains the datasets, h_set is the hydraulic head (output) and k_set is the conductivity (input). the numbers are the seeds that generated the data, so h_set_1400to2000.txt is the output generated by seeds 1400 to 2000 by jeffreys code. The data is generated by data_gen.py. Manually change the start_seed and end_seed to generate more data.

## code
jeffrey_code.py is the code jeffrey wrote but now in a .py format that can be imported in other .py files.

cnn.py is my cnn (run this one to retrain the model, it saves the model outputs in pred_train.txt and pred_test.txt.

analysis can be run to see how good the saved predicted results match the ground truth.
